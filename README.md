# Coding-Challenge-79---TV-Shows

To Watch or Not to watch - That is the Question

We take a peek into a family of four for this coding challenge. Everyday there is an argument over what movie/TV show to watch and someone inevitably ends up disappointed. So the mother - a keen bioinformatician - decides to take matters into her own hands. She decides to make a TV schedule for the month of July that satisfies every single whim and fancy of her family. She downloads a dataset of all the TV shows, movies and series on the OTT they pay hefty money for and keeping in mind what her family wants, she writes a program scheduling what to watch.

No movies/shows must be repeated at all within the timespan
At four must have at least one movie/show per week that is to their liking
No one must have their liked/disliked categories shown on consecutive days
Add any other rules that you feel like adding to give as much variety to the schedule as you can
Optional: You can extend the schedule to beyond July and you could have it for the entire year from July 2023 to June 2024 and add special themes to it such as Christmas movies around Christmas.
